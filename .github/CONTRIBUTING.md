# Contributing to Magic-Spoiler #
Thank you for your interest in contributing to Magic-Spoiler!<br>
This project is an attempt to create a central source for new Magic: the Gathering spoilers and provide data files for miscellaneous projects like [Cockatrice](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Cockatrice).


## How can I help? ##
Magic-Spoiler grabs its data from [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/), but there can be errors of course.
If you want to improve the card data and fix errors for all users, you simply have to report them directly to Scryfall.
Once you've found a mistake in our data files, make sure that error hasn't already been fixed at the Scryfall webpage in betweeen. If it's still present there, let's get it fixed!
- If the error is with one of the fields in a card (e.g. a spelling error or missing cmc) search for that card on the Scryfall webpage. Below the card art on the left, there are some links. Choose the botton one (`Report card issue`) and provide the information in the form. Once their team check & fixes the errors, it'll show up in our spoiler files, too.<br>
It only takes a few days - be patient.
- If the card is a legitimate spoiler and it isn't showing up yet, you can request it by [contacting the Scryfall support](https://scryfall.com/contact) and let them know. Make sure to link the official spoiler source in your report.
- If the card shouldn't exist at all, let the Scryfall team know as well, please.

What you should **NOT** do however, is to submit PR's to our files branch and fix the xml files there directly.<br>
You have to provide updates to Scryfall as all other changes would get overridden again.


## Anything else? ##
If you notice any other errors or have suggestions to the code, please [file an issue](https://github.com/Cockatrice/Magic-Spoiler/issues) in our repository.
